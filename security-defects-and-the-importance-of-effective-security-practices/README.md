# Security defects and the importance of effective security practices

1. **Security Defects and Fame**:
   * Security vulnerabilities like Heartbleed, Shellshock, Spectre, and Meltdown have become high-profile issues.
   * These bugs can gain significant media attention and have serious financial implications.
   * The field of security research has expanded, with many researchers and startups capitalizing on finding and publicizing significant vulnerabilities.
2. **Financial Implications and Responsible Disclosure**:
   * Finding and publicizing major security bugs can lead to financial gain.
   * Alternatively, vulnerabilities can be sold on the black market or responsibly disclosed to vendors.
   * The cost of breaches can be substantial, both financially and in terms of reputation.
3. **Regulatory Oversight**:
   * The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) monitors companies for security claims.
   * Companies can face consent decrees for insufficient security practices, which can last up to 20 years and involve strict regulatory oversight.
4. **Cost of Breaches**:
   * The Ponemon Institute estimates a cost of $141 per record for data breaches, with average costs around $3.62 million.
   * The black market for zero-day vulnerabilities is growing, with prices ranging between $5,000 and $25,000.
5. **Real-World Examples**:
   * **Trend Micro**: Researchers found 223 vulnerabilities in six months, highlighting the need for thorough security practices.
   * **Equifax**: A known vulnerability in an open-source package led to a major breach, resulting in high-level job losses and significant fallout.
6. **Focus Areas for Security**:
   * Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a common vulnerability, particularly in cloud environments.
   * High-severity issues like OS command injection and SQL injection also need attention.
   * Future presentations will cover various types of security vulnerabilities, starting with injection attacks.
7. **Challenges in Secure Software Development**:
   * Developers often face time pressures and focus on feature functionality, sometimes at the expense of security.
   * Hackers have the advantage of time and resources, often supported by nation-states.
8. **Developer Responsibilities**:
   * Developers should stay informed about security best practices, such as the SANS 25.
   * Think like a hacker to anticipate potential abuse cases.
   * Implement key defenses: input validation, output standardization, strong encryption, and robust authentication/authorization.
9. **Handling Existing Vulnerabilities**:
   * Address existing bugs through redesign or technology upgrades if necessary.
   * Avoid "spot-fixing" and consider architectural changes to improve overall security.
10. **Recognizing the Impact of Security Bugs**:
    * Security bugs are not just software errors; they compromise data and can lead to significant press and legal issues.
    * Take security issues seriously and address them promptly to avoid serious consequences, as demonstrated by the Equifax breach.
