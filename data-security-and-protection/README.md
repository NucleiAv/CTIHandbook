# Data Security and Protection

**1. Overview of Data Security and Protection:**

* **Definition:** Data security is the process of protecting critical business assets (data) against unauthorized or unwanted use.
* **Goal:** To combine people, processes, and technology to protect data throughout its life cycle.
* **Team Effort:** Enterprise data protection is a collective effort involving multiple stakeholders.

**2. CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability):**

* **Confidentiality:** Ensuring data secrecy, where access is restricted to authorized actors.
  * Example: A university student’s financial records are accessible to parents, but academic records are not unless authorized.
* **Integrity:** Ensuring data is trustworthy, accurate, and untampered.
  * Example: Only certain actors, like instructors, should be allowed to change grades.
* **Availability:** Ensuring data is accessible by appropriate users within a reasonable time frame.
  * Example: Academic progress information must be available during course registration but not necessarily 24/7.

**3. Data at Rest vs. Data in Transit:**

* **Data in Transit:** Data being transmitted from one point to another (e.g., over networks).
* **Data at Rest:** Data stored on endpoints like servers, laptops, mobile devices, and backup devices.

**4. Threats to Data:**

* **Deliberate Attacks:** Intentional actions by bad actors aiming to compromise systems and steal or damage data.
  * Types: Denial of Service, socially engineered attacks, internal and external threats.
* **Inadvertent Attacks:** Accidental breaches due to hardware failure, natural disasters, or human error.
* **Threat Profiles:** Used to predict potential threats and determine protective measures.

**5. Importance of Data Protection:**

* **Revenue and Profits:** Data breaches can cut into revenue and increase costs.
* **Reputation:** Breaches can damage an organization’s reputation.
* **Regulatory Mandates:** Legal and industry standards may impose penalties or requirements for data breaches.
* **Digital Transformation:** Data protection is essential for organizations moving services online or developing new offerings.

**6. Key Considerations:**

* **Cost of Attacks:** Understanding the financial impact of data breaches can be challenging, especially when assessing intangible assets like reputation.
* **Security Investment:** While it’s important not to overspend on security, some assets, like brand reputation, are difficult to quantify.

**7. Challenges and Pitfalls:**

* Data security and protection are necessary but come with significant challenges, including managing both intentional and unintentional threats and aligning security investments with asset value.
