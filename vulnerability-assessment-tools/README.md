# Vulnerability Assessment Tools

1. **Vulnerability Scanners**:
   * Software suites designed to assess systems for potential weaknesses.
   * **Key Capabilities**:
     * Maintain an up-to-date vulnerability and exploit database.
     * Detect genuine vulnerabilities with minimal false positives.
     * Perform multiple scans simultaneously and trend analyses.
     * Generate clear reports and provide recommendations for mitigating discovered vulnerabilities.
   * **Main Components**:
     * **Engine Scanners**: Perform security checks and identify vulnerabilities.
     * **Databases**: Store vulnerability information, scan results, and other data.
     * **Report Modules**: Provide various types of reports for different audiences.
     * **User Interface**: GUI or command line for operating the scanner.
2. **Types of Vulnerability Scans**:
   * **Internal Scan**:
     * Performed within the network to identify internal threats.
     * Focuses on critical network components (e.g., routers, servers, databases).
   * **External Scan**:
     * Conducted from outside the network, focusing on internet-facing assets.
     * Aims to detect vulnerabilities that could allow external attackers to gain access.
3.  **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)**:

    * **Purpose**: Assigns severity rankings to vulnerabilities, ranging from 0 (least severe) to 10 (most severe).

    * **Scores**:
      * **Base Score**: Measures exploitability and impact (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability - CIA triad).
      * **Temporal Score**: Considers exploit maturity, remediation level, and report confidence.
      * **Environmental Score**: Customizes the impact based on the organization’s specific environment.
    * **Usage**: Standardized score helps in prioritizing risk and ensuring consistency across the industry.
4. **Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs)**:
   * **Purpose**: Developed by DISA (Defense Information System Agency) to standardize security configurations across DoD (Dept of Defense) IT infrastructure.
   * **Scope**: Covers a wide range of software and hardware, including operating systems, databases, and mobile devices.
   * **Access**: Available on the DoD’s public Cyber Exchange website, providing the latest STIGs.
5. **Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks and Controls**:
   * **Purpose**: Provides security configuration guides and controls, developed by industry experts.
   * **CIS Controls**:
     * A set of prioritized actions (20 controls) forming a defense-in-depth strategy.
     * Categorized into three groups:
       * **Basic**: Essential cyber hygiene practices.
       * **Foundational**: Key security actions that address foundational cyber threats.
       * **Organizational**: Security processes and procedures that enhance an organization’s cybersecurity posture.
     *   **Implementation Groups**:

         * **Group 1**: Basic measures for small or low-sensitivity environments.
         * **Group 2**: Focuses on managing sensitive client or company information.
         * **Group 3**: Addresses high-security needs, including zero-day and targeted attacks.
