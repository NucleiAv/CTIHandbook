# DevSecOps and Security Automation

#### 1. **Cloud and Security**

* **Cloud Innovation & Speed:** The adoption of cloud technology has raised expectations for faster innovation and provisioning.
* **Security & Velocity:** Traditional security checks can slow down this process, so organizations need strategies to maintain both speed and security.

#### 2. **DevOps to DevSecOps Transition**

* **DevOps Philosophy:** Originally, DevOps focused on rapid development (development teams) and system stability (operations teams).
* **DevSecOps Integration:** Integrates security into DevOps, focusing on creating secure, vulnerability-free releases without compromising speed.

#### 3. **IBM DevSecOps Reference Architecture**

* **Holistic Framework:** Encompasses technical framework, mindset, culture, strategy, governance, risk, and compliance.
* **Secure Development:** Guides secure development and operations, embedding security and continuous learning.

#### 4. **Strategy, Governance, & Risk Management**

* **Central Role:** Aligns with strategy and governance, incorporating continuous assurance and risk management into operational processes.
* **Cultural Alignment:** Success requires aligning people and culture with desired ways of working.

#### 5. **Security Training & Awareness**

* **Training & Awareness:** Teams need to understand the role of security and how to integrate it seamlessly.
* **Autonomy & Knowledge:** Teams should have the autonomy to own solutions and be equipped with the necessary knowledge.

#### 6. **Continuous Improvement & Collaboration**

* **Learning from Mistakes:** Continuous improvement and learning are vital.
* **Collaboration:** Collaboration between team members with different skill sets is crucial for secure deployments.

#### 7. **Security Requirements & Architecture**

* **Security Epics:** Security should be integrated into project backlogs and aligned with threat identification and risk assessment.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** Systems must be architected with threats and risks in mind, considering regulations like GDPR.

#### 8. **Code & Build Phase**

* **Shift Left Strategy:** Security checks (e.g., vulnerability scanning) should be integrated early in the development lifecycle to catch issues before code is committed.
* **Real-time Feedback:** Developers should receive real-time feedback on vulnerabilities and code weaknesses.

#### 9. **Automated Security Testing**

* **Automated Tests:** Automated security checks should be a part of testing and compliance to ensure continuous security assurance.
* **Shift Left & Automation:** The shift left approach empowers developers to fix issues early, reducing the need for extensive manual penetration testing.

#### 10. **Importance of Comprehensive Testing**

* **Integrated Tests:** Comprehensive, integrated tests ensure system changes donâ€™t affect security and compliance.
* **Real-Time Assurance:** Continuous testing and automated security checks provide real-time assurance and reduce risks.
