# Application Security

#### 1. **Application Security Overview**

* **Definition**: Application security involves measures to improve security by finding, fixing, and preventing security vulnerabilities.
* **Key Stages**: Security vulnerabilities are addressed during design, development, deployment, upgrade, and maintenance stages.

#### 2. **Key Terminology**

* **Network Security**: Protection at the network level (e.g., routers, servers, firewalls).
* **Application Security**: Protection at the software level (e.g., websites, databases, mobile apps).
* **Threat**: Potential for a security violation (e.g., malware, hackers).
* **Risk**: Likelihood of an attack (e.g., risk of malware compromising an application).
* **Vulnerability**: A security flaw in code that can be exploited.

#### 3. **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**

* **Common Phases**: Plan, develop, test, deploy, maintain.
* **Popular Methodologies**:
  * **Waterfall**: Top-down approach, simple but inflexible.
  * **Agile**: Iterative approach, flexible but may neglect security testing.
  * **Scrum**: Agile variant with focused sprints (1-4 weeks).
  * **Spiral**: Iterative with a focus on minimizing risk, more secure but slower.
  * **Iterative**: Development in smaller prototypes, lessons learned from each cycle.

#### 4. **Penetration Testing Types**

* **White-Box Testing**: Attackers have detailed system information, increases likelihood of finding flaws.
* **Black-Box Testing**: Attackers have no prior information, simulates external attacks.
* **Gray-Box Testing**: Combines elements of both white-box and black-box testing for balanced assessment.

#### 5. **Security Testing Techniques**

* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**:
  * Analyzes source code for vulnerabilities before deployment.
  * Requires access to source code, fewer false positives, needs expert configuration.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**:
  * Scans application during runtime by feeding the URL into a scanner.
  * Highly scalable, but prone to false positives and negatives.
* **Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)**:
  * Combines SAST and DAST, assesses applications from within using software instrumentation.
  * Provides access to code, traffic, and backend connections.

#### 6. **Integration in Information Security**

* Both network and application security are integral parts of overall information security programs, working together to mitigate IT risks.

#### 7. **Industry Tools**

* Technologies used for application security include:
  * **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**
  * **Source Code Analyzers**
  * **Penetration Testing Tools**
  * **Security Testing Automation Tools** (e.g., SAST, DAST, IAST)
