1. **Introduction to Security Intelligence:**
   * IBM introduced the term "security intelligence" to emphasize the value derived from analyzing security data similarly to business data (e.g., marketing).
   * The goal is to provide actionable insights that reduce risk and operational effort for any organization.
2. **Data Collected for Security Intelligence:**
   * Security intelligence solutions gather data including:
     * Logs
     * Events
     * Network flows
     * User identities and activities
     * Asset profiles and locations
     * Vulnerabilities
     * Asset configurations
     * External threat data
3. **Characteristics of Security Intelligence:**
   * **Advanced Analytics:**
     * Security intelligence involves reviewing and normalizing vast amounts of data to highlight critical issues needing immediate attention.
   * **Iterative Process:**
     * The process continuously tunes system analytics and rules, eliminating false positives, and refining incident detection.
4. **Core Security Intelligence Solutions:**
   * **Risk Manager, Vulnerability Manager, and Incident Forensics:**
     * These tools improve accuracy and context throughout the security event timeline, from detection to remediation.
   * **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Engine:**
     * Central to improving security visibility and response.
5. **Three Pillars of Effective Threat Detection:**
   * **Visibility:**
     * Centralizing data from all environments (on-premises, cloud, operational) to gain a comprehensive view of the security state.
   * **Automation:**
     * Automating insights with analytics to prioritize critical threats.
   *   **Proactivity:**

       * Shifting from reactive to proactive threat hunting, enabling faster response and continuous improvement.

6. **Security Effectiveness Report 2020:**
   * Reveals many companies mistakenly believe their security investments are effective, while undetected breaches are common.
   * Highlights the importance of combining security effectiveness with financial impact insights.
7. **Key Takeaways from SANS Report:**
   * **Visibility:** A major concern, especially regarding privileged user and credential abuse.
   * **Incident Sources:** Endpoint alerts and network access devices are top sources of incident information.
   * **Hybrid Environments:** Organizations often operate a mix of on-premise and cloud environments, necessitating versatile security intelligence solutions.
8. **Conclusion:**
   * Security intelligence is essential for gaining insights across the security event timeline, enabling organizations to detect threats, respond faster, and continuously improve their defenses.
