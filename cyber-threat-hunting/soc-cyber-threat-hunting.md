* **Next-Gen SOCs:**
  * Defined as intelligence-led, proactive cyber threat hunting centers.
  * Focus on moving beyond traditional, reactive SOC operations to anticipate and mitigate threats before they materialize.
* **Traditional SOC Operations:**
  * SOC analysts (levels 1 through 4) are skilled at working within a scripted, reactive environment.
  * Cyber forensic investigation is typically performed by level 3 and level 4 analysts within the SOC, and it is a reactive process. In this context, when a threat has been carried out and a vulnerability exploited, an investigation is necessary. While you are indeed searching for the threat, it is done within the framework of a cyber forensic investigation.
  * Current practices involve cyber forensic investigations, which are reactive rather than proactive.
* **Proactive Cyber Threat Hunting:**
  * A proactive approach to identifying, intercepting, tracking, investigating, and eliminating adversaries before they cause harm.
  * Requires a different skill set, often missing in traditional SOCs, such as those found in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) teams.
* **Human-Centered Threats:**
  * All threats, whether cyber, physical, or related to terrorism, are human-driven.
  * Understanding the human element behind threats is critical for effective threat hunting.
* **Importance of Intelligence in Threat Hunting:**
  * Effective threat hunting requires actionable intelligence.
  * Understanding threat actors, their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and linking this to the cyber kill chain is crucial.
* **Cyber Kill Chain:**
  * Begins with reconnaissance, where adversaries gather information on targets.
  * Reconnaissance is a critical stage as it defines the adversaryâ€™s strategy for exploiting weaknesses.
* **Challenges in SOC Maturity:**
  * Many organizations delay proactive threat hunting to mature their traditional SOC operations.
  * Waiting to mature SOC operations poses a risk, as threat actors continually evolve.
* **Indicators of Concern (IoCs):**
  * Introduced as a proactive approach, different from traditional Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).
  * These are proactive signs that suggest a potential threat, guiding organizations to take preventive actions.
* **Evolving Threat Landscape:**
  * SOCs must adapt quickly to keep pace with evolving threats and adversaries who are often ahead in the threat landscape.
  * Proactive threat hunting is essential to leveling the playing field.
* **Starting Point for SOC Evolution:**
  * Emphasizes the need to develop the right skill set within SOCs for proactive threat hunting.
  * Suggests starting with understanding global and regional threat landscapes and tailoring threat intelligence to specific organizations.
