# Cyber Threat Intelligence

1. **Definition**:
   * Cyber threat intelligence is information about threats and threat actors that helps mitigate harmful events in cyberspace.
2. **Benefits**:
   * Develops a proactive cybersecurity posture.
   * Enhances threat detection and decision-making during and after cyber intrusions.

#### Current Challenges and Trends

1. **Data Breach Statistics (2019)**:
   * Over 8.5 billion records exposed, a significant increase from 2018.
   * Misconfigurations were the leading cause, making up 86% of records compromised.
   * Human error, including phishing, was a major vector but less frequent than in 2018.
   * IoT devices are increasingly targeted, with a shift from consumer electronics to enterprise-grade hardware.
   * Major cost amplifiers include third-party involvement, cloud migration, IT complexity, and compliance failures.
2. **Cost Amplifiers**:
   * **Third-Party Involvement**: Increases breach cost by $370,000.
   * **Cloud Migration**: Increases breach cost by $300,000.
   * **System Complexity**: Increases breach cost by $290,000.
3. **Skills Gap**:
   * There are 2.8 million cybersecurity professionals worldwide; 4.07 million more are needed.

#### Threat Landscape

1. **Types of Attackers**:
   * Organized criminals, hacktivists, governments, and adversaries driven by financial gain, politics, or notoriety.
   * Methods include targeted attacks using social media and exploiting trust.
2. **Cost of Breaches**:
   * Average cost of a data breach: $3.92 million.
   * Average size of a breach: Over 25,000 records.
   * Time to identify and contain a breach: Average of 279 days.

#### Insider Threats

1. **Types**:
   * Negligent or inadvertent employees.
   * Criminal or malicious insiders.
   * Credential thieves.
2. **Cost and Frequency**:
   * Average cost of insider threats: Over $871,000 per incident (up from $493,000 in 2016).
