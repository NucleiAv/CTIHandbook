# Application Security Standards and Regulations

1. **Threat Modeling Overview**:
   * Threat modeling helps identify, enumerate, and prioritize potential threats, such as structural vulnerabilities or the absence of safeguards.
   * Its purpose is to provide a systematic analysis of necessary controls or defenses, considering the system's nature, probable attacker's profile, likely attack vectors, and desired assets.
2. **Threat Modeling Methodologies**:
   * **STRIDE**: Developed by Microsoft in 1999, focuses on finding threats in products using patterns and practices.
   * **PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)**: A seven-step, risk-centric methodology that aligns business objectives with technical requirements and focuses on dynamic threat identification and mitigation.
   * **TRIKE**: Uses threat models as a risk management tool, establishing stakeholder-defined acceptable risk levels, and constructing a risk model based on assets, roles, actions, and risk exposure.
   * **VAST (Visual Agile and Simple Threat Modeling)**: Scalable across infrastructure and the SDLC, integrates with Agile methodologies, and provides actionable outputs for stakeholders without requiring specific security expertise.
3. **Security Standards and Regulations**:
   * **CERT C Coding Standard**: Developed by the CERT Coordination Center, focuses on improving software safety, reliability, and security for C programming.
   * **Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)**: A category system for software weaknesses, sustained by the Mitre Corporation and supported by US CERT and the Department of Homeland Security.
   * **Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG)**: Developed by the Defense Information Systems Agency, standardizes security protocols across networks, servers, and systems.
   * **ISO Standards**:
     * **ISO 27034**: Describes minimum requirements for application security controls (ASC) and maps to a prediction application security rationale (PASR).
     * **ISO 24772**: Provides guidance on avoiding vulnerabilities through language selection and use in programming.
   * **PCI Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**: Mandated by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, increases controls around cardholder data to reduce credit card fraud.
   * **NIST SP 800-53**: Catalogs security and privacy controls for all US federal information systems, published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
4. **Key Regulations**:
   * **Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)**: Modernized financial services, allowing more information sharing but with privacy limitations.
   * **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Modernized healthcare information flow and protected personally identifiable information.
   * **Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)**: Set requirements for US public company boards and management, including provisions for evidence preservation during federal investigations.
5. **Compliance Controls**:
   * Understanding and implementing security standards and regulations are crucial for stopping attacks and ensuring application security. Compliance is an integral part of the application security landscape.
