# Cyber Threat Hunting

* **Proactive Cyber Threat Hunting**:
  * Importance of integrating proactive cyber threat hunting into SOC operations to mitigate future attacks.
  * Organizations need intelligence to protect against both internal and external threats.
  * Insights gained from threat hunting become part of the organization's cybersecurity strategy and tactics.
* **Global Cyber Trends and Challenges**:
  * Cyber threats are varied, with sources including nation-states, transnational criminals, and cybercriminals.
  * The Internet of Things (IoT) increases cybersecurity challenges as more devices become wireless and IP-enabled.
  * Organizations face challenges due to cyber skill shortages and increasing complexity in managing cybersecurity.
* **Dwell Time and Vulnerability**:
  * Average dwell time for a vulnerability or threat within a network is around 191 days, highlighting the need for improved detection and response.
* **Threat Actor Sophistication**:
  * Threat actors are highly resourceful and sophisticated, often having more time, money, and resources than defenders.
  * They operate like businesses, providing services such as Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) and Malware as a Service (MaaS).
* **Data as a Critical Asset**:
  * Data is a critical asset in cybersecurity, used to identify and track various forms of criminal activities, including cybercrime, terrorism, and financial crimes.
  * Effective data analysis is essential for identifying threats and responding appropriately.
* **SOC Challenges**:
  * The need to increase the speed and accuracy of response in SOCs.
  * Traditional SOCs (Tier 1, Tier 2) focus on known threats, but the greatest damage often comes from the 20% of unknown threats.
  * The need to evolve SOC operations to address these unknown threats through more advanced techniques, including cognitive and intelligence-led approaches.
* **Intelligent-Led Cognitive SOC**:
  * Moving towards an Intelligent-Led Cognitive SOC is crucial for dealing with emerging and unknown threats.
  * This involves incorporating advanced analytics and cognitive technologies to improve threat detection and response.
