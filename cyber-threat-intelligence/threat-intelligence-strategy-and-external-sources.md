**1. Strategic Use of Threat Intelligence**:

* **Process Overview**:
  * **Identification**: Identify sources to discover threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks.
  * **Collection**: Gather data from internal (network scanning, endpoint security) and external sources.
  * **Processing**: Normalize, correlate, verify, and prioritize data. Use automation and orchestration to handle large volumes of information.
  * **Analysis**: Analyze data to understand current and future threats. Use SIEM tools for analysis.
  * **Communication**: Share information tailored to different organizational levels:
    * **Level 1 Analysts**: Real-time monitoring, detection, and initial investigation.
    * **Level 2 and 3 Analysts**: In-depth investigation, containment, and remediation.
    * **Operational Leaders**: Guide and prioritize technical staff actions.
    * **Strategic Leaders**: Assist CISOs and senior leaders in resource allocation and risk management.

**2. Intelligence Areas**:

* **Tactical**: Focuses on malware analysis and enrichment.
* **Operational**: Understand adversarial capabilities, infrastructure, and TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures).
* **Strategic**: Understand high-level trends and make predictions.
