# Practice Lab: Network Protocol Analyzers

We learn best with active, hands-on learning. This lab provides a cloud-based environment that contains all the software you need to complete these lab tasks successfully.

1. Open the [Hands-on Lab: Network Protocol Analyzers](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-CS0204EN-Coursera/labs/Wireshark.md.html) lab instructions in a separate tab or window so that you can view these lab instructions and your **Cloud Workspace** window simultaneously.
2. Next, in this window, select the check box option to accept the lab terms and open the **My Cloud Workspace** window.
3. Within the **My Cloud Workspace** window, click the **Expand** arrow or move the slider to the right to maximize the view of your **Cloud Workspace** window.
4. We suggest placing your **Cloud Workspace** window and the lab instructions side-by-side onscreen. Then, resize the **Cloud Workspace** window and instruction windows, as needed, for your best viewing experience.&#x20;
