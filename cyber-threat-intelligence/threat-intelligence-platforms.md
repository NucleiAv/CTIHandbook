# Threat Intelligence Platforms

**1. Definition and Purpose**:

* **Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP)**: Emerging technology to aggregate, correlate, and analyze threat data from multiple sources in real-time.
* **Goal**: Support defensive actions through automated workflows for streamlined threat detection, management, and analysis.

**2. Key Features**:

* **Collect**:
  * Aggregates data from multiple formats (CSV, XML, Email, etc.).
  * Differs from SIEMs, which handle threat feeds but are less suited for unstructured data.
* **Correlate**:
  * Automatically analyzes and correlates data to understand the who, why, and how of attacks.
  * Essential for automation and effective threat blocking.
* **Enrichment & Contextualization**:
  * Augments data with third-party applications for comprehensive threat context.
  * Supports SOC and incident response teams with detailed threat actor information.
* **Analyze**:
  * Automatically analyzes threat indicators and their relationships.
  * Identifies tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
  * Includes visualization capabilities for complex relationships.
* **Integrate**:
  * Integrates analyzed data with other security tools (SIEMs, ticketing systems, firewalls, IDS).
* **Act**:
  * Handles response processing, collaboration, and mitigation planning.
  * Supports communication within security teams and external information sharing.

**3. Examples of Threat Intelligence Platforms**:

* **Recorded Future**:
  * Centralizes and contextualizes threat data.
  * Uses NLP and machine learning for structuring and connecting data.
  * Features collaboration tools and customizable intelligence.
* **FireEye**:
  * **Fusion Intelligence**: Includes operational, cyber crime, and espionage intelligence.
  * **Strategic Intelligence**: Aligns resources against likely threats.
  * **Operational Intelligence**: Prioritizes alerts and improves defenses.
  * **Vulnerability Intelligence**: Identifies and mitigates significant vulnerabilities.
  * **Cyber Physical Intelligence**: Insights into industrial and operational technology threats.
  * **Cyber Crime Intelligence**: Analysis of financial crime threats.
  * **Cyber Espionage Intelligence**: Understanding of strategic adversaries.
* **IBM X-Force Exchange**:
  * Cloud-based platform for threat research and collaboration.
  * Integrates with other solutions and provides near real-time decision-making.
* **TruSTAR**:
  * Manages data across tools and teams, enhances investigations and response.
  * Features include streamlined workflows, secure access control, advanced search, and automated data ingestion & normalization.

**4. Considerations**:

* Evaluate free vs. paid offerings based on required access and budget.
* Review platform features in relation to specific organizational needs.
